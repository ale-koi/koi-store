# Little Koi Store

A colorful manga store created to discover new titles only using the demographic as filter. (* >ω<)

It's meant to be playful and simple, like walking around a second-hand store to see what could be waiting on the bookshelves. 

The use of kaomojis as part of the aesthetic is part of game, showing a little emotion when finding an error or some kind of interaction. o(*////▽////*)q
